# Naive Bayes Classifier
## Description
This repository contains the implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier for pattern recognition tasks. The classifier is designed to handle various types of data and provides a robust solution for classification problems.

### Introduction
The Naive Bayes Classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model used for classification tasks. It is based on Bayes’ theorem and assumes independence between features. This repository includes a detailed implementation and examples to help you understand and apply the Naive Bayes algorithm.

### Usage
To use the Naive Bayes Classifier, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Samahussien7/naive-bayes-classifier.git
```

### Contributing
