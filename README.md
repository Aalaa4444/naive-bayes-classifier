Introduction
The Naive Bayes Classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model used for classification tasks. It is based on Bayes’ theorem and assumes independence between features. This repository includes a detailed implementation and examples to help you understand and apply the Naive Bayes algorithm.

Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
To use the Naive Bayes Classifier, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Samahussien7/naive-bayes-classifier.git

Examples
Check out the Pattern5.ipynb notebook for detailed examples and usage of the Naive Bayes Classifier. This notebook demonstrates how to preprocess data, train the classifier, and evaluate its performance.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes. Ensure that your code adheres to the project’s coding standards and includes appropriate tests.
